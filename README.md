# Face generation
In this project, you'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

### Get the Data

You'll be using two datasets in this project:

- MNIST
- CelebA

Since the celebA dataset is complex and you're doing GANs in a project for the first time, we want you to test your neural network on MNIST before CelebA. Running the GANs on MNIST will allow you to see how well your model trains sooner.

If you're using FloydHub, set data_dir to "/input" and use the FloydHub data ID "R5KrjnANiKVhLWAkpXhNBe".

## Explore the Data

### MNIST

As you're aware, the MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits. You can view the first number of examples by changing show_n_images.
